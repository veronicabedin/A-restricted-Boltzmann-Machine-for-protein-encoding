# A-restricted-Boltzmann-Machine-for-protein-encoding
Assignment for the Laboratory of Computational Physics (mod. B) call - March 2023

This is one of the project that we were required to complete for the Laboratory of Computational Physics class.
We implemented a Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) in the Jupyter notebook RBM-notebook.ipynb, connected to the RBM class contained in RBM.py
The PDF contains a little paper that we were asked to compile in order to present our work.
